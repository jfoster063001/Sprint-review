How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
  User needs are essential to figure out what are the basic needs of any application. This is the foundation on which the app is built.
Putting these needs into user stories will help the developers and the testers in their job to meet these requirements. The testing team
will take a look at the stories and be able to design tests to make sure the product is working as expected for the user. The Developer will
also use the user stories to prioritize and break down all the requirements needed.

How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
  The first step in developing programs is finding a problem and figuring out a way to solve that. This first step is essential to get right
beacause if you find a problem but then don't accurately drill down to the reason that problem exists you might end up not solving the problem
and merely putting a minor fix. This would be the difference between a good app and a great app.
